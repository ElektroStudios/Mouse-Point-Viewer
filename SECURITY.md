## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities, please go to the Issues section and open a new ticket to get support.

You can expect an update on your report within few days to weeks, although this may vary depending on the severity and complexity of the reported vulnerability.

After submitting a vulnerability, you can expect one of the following responses:
- If the vulnerability is accepted, actions will be taken to address it, and updates on the progress will be provided.
- If the vulnerability is rejected, clear reasons will be provided, along with, if possible, suggestions for addressing any misunderstandings or errors in the report.
